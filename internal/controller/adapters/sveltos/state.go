					FailureMessage doesn't have an error belonging to the service. If it does then
					set the state to the status of the entire Helm Feature as a fallback (done earlier)
				  by doing nothing. These states would just be transitory because once the entire
					Helm Feature's status moves on from Provisioning to some other non-transitory value
					then we will be able to determine the actual state of the services.
