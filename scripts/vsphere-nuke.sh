# Removes vSphere VMs left behind by CAPV during E2E tests.
# Scoped to VMs under ${VSPHERE_FOLDER} in ${VSPHERE_DATACENTER} whose names
# start with ${CLUSTER_NAME}- (the CI run's cluster prefix). Non-VM inventory
# objects (folders, resource pools, networks, datastores) are never enumerated;
# templates share the VM object type but never match the ${CLUSTER_NAME}-*
# name filter, so they are safe as long as the folder/prefix conventions hold.
#
# Meant to be invoked via `make dev-vsphere-nuke`; standalone usage requires
# the VSPHERE_* env vars listed below plus a govc binary on PATH (or GOVC).
